# 🚗 Object Detection for Self-Driving Cars

This project demonstrates real-time object detection for autonomous vehicles using the YOLOv3 deep learning model. The system identifies and labels objects such as cars, people, traffic signs, and more from video streams — simulating how self-driving cars perceive their environment.
